            "The midland rockhounds are a minor league baseball team based in midland, texas. They play in the double-a central and are currently affiliated with the oakland athletics major league club. The team has had a few different affiliations and names since its inception in 1972. Initially, they were known as the midland cubs, affiliated with the chicago cubs from 1972 to 1984. After that, they became the midland angels, affiliated with the california angels from 1985 to 1998. In 1999, they took on their current name, the rockhounds, and began their affiliation with the oakland athletics.\n\nThe name \"rockhounds\" is a reference to geologists, who are sometimes called rockhounds, and it is a nod to the oil and gas industry in the midland area. Throughout their history, the team has won seven texas league championships, in 1975, 2005, 2009, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The rockhounds have also received various awards, including the texas league organization of the year and the bob frietas award, which is double-a baseball's highest honor.\n\nOver the years, the team has seen an impressive fan turnout, averaging over 250,000 fans every season since 2002 when they moved to momentum bank ballpark. The rockhounds have not only achieved success on the field but also off the field with their dedicated fan base and commitment to their community."

Ford, with 120 points, was fifteen points ahead of Dodge in the battle for third place. Mark Martin was the race's defending champion.\n\nA number of drivers competing in the 2010 Chase for the Sprint Cup entered the race optimistic about their chances of winning the championship. Biffle argued that he, Burton, or Stewart were \"capable of winning it\". Johnson, who already had eighteen previous wins in the Chase, observed that \"those 10 races in the Chase is its own world. The people act and react differently under pressure, and for the last four years we have done a great job in that environment.\" Hamlin commented, \"Reliability is the only thing we need to work on. It's taken us out of the last three Chases, not being reliable. You have to have it to be the champion.\" Ray Evernham also opined on Hamlin, \"I think Denny knows that he has the talent to win the championship. I think that he's got focus right now and a good, veteran crew chief in Mike Ford. If Toyota gives him the speed, he could be a threat.\"\n\nPractice and qualifying \nThree practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—one on Friday, and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, and the second 50 minutes. The final session lasted 60 minutes. During the first practice session, Stewart was fastest, placing ahead of Edwards in second and Marcos Ambrose in third. A. J. Allmendinger was scored fourth, and Kyle Busch placed fifth."

Like other industrialized countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia has treated stormwater runoff as a liability and nuisance, endangering human health and property. This resulted in a strong focus on the design of stormwater management systems that rapidly convey stormwater runoff directly to streams with little or no focus on ecosystem preservation. This management approach results in what is referred to as urban stream syndrome. Heavy rainfall flows rapidly into streams carrying pollutants and sediments washed off from impervious surfaces, resulting in streams carrying elevated concentrations of pollutants, nutrients, and suspended solids. Increased peak flow also alters channel morphology and stability, further proliferating sedimentation and drastically reducing biotic richness.\n\nIncreased recognition of urban stream syndrome in the 1960s resulted in some movement toward holistic stormwater management in Australia. Awareness increased greatly during the 1990s with the Federal government and scientists cooperating through the Cooperative Research Centre program. Increasingly city planners have recognised the need for an integrated management approach to potable, waste, and stormwater management, to enable cities to adapt and become resilient to the pressure which population growth, urban densification and climate change places on ageing and increasingly expensive water infrastructure. Additionally, Australia's arid conditions mean it is particularly vulnerable to climate change, which together with its reliance on surface water sources, combined with one of the most severe droughts (from 2000–2010) since European settlement, highlight the fact that major urban centers face increasing water shortages. This has begun shifting the perception of stormwater runoff from strictly a liability and nuisance to that of having value as a water resource resulting in changing stormwater management practices.\n\nAustralian states, building on the Federal government's foundational research in the 1990s, began releasing WSUD guidelines with Western Australia first releasing guidelines in 1994. Victoria released guidelines on the best practice environmental management of urban stormwater in 1999 (developed in consultation with New South Wales) and similar documents were released by Queensland through Brisbane City Council in 1999."

The Mumbai mafia has been his focus in books such as Dongri to Dubai: Six Decades of the Mumbai Mafia, Mafia Queens of Mumbai, My Name is Abu Salem and Byculla to Bangkok.\n\nZaidi began his career in journalism while working for the newspaper The Asian Age, where he became the resident editor. Zaidi later worked for several other periodicals, including The Indian Express, Mid-Day and Mumbai Mirror. His in-depth research on the Mumbai mafia has been used by international authors, including Misha Glenny in McMafia and Vikram Chandra in his book Sacred Games. Zaidi was once kidnapped in Iraq.\n\nZaidi has covered the Mumbai mafia for several decades. His 2002 book Black Friday detailed the 1993 Mumbai bombings, an attack consisting of thirteen explosions that killed 250 people. The book was adapted two years later, in 2004, into a film by Anurag Kashyap also titled Black Friday. The film was so controversial that the Indian Censor Board did not allow it to be released in India for three years. It was finally released on 9 February 2007 after the Supreme Court of India allowed it following the TADA court verdict in the '93 Bombay blast case. In Dongri to Dubai: Six Decades of the Mumbai Mafia, a historical account of the Mumbai mafia, Zaidi conducted an interview with crime boss Dawood Ibrahim, who is suspected of having orchestrated the bombings. The book was adapted into the film Shootout at Wadala by Sanjay Gupta.\n\nZaidi was also an associate producer of the HBO documentary Terror in Mumbai, which is based on the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai.\n\nThe 2015 Kabir Khan film Phantom, starring Saif Ali Khan and Katrina Kaif, is an adaptation of Zaidi's book Mumbai Avengers; the screenplay was written in conjunction with the author.\n\nFarhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani of Excel Entertainment are making a web series titled Dongri to Dubai, an adaptation of Zaidi's book. The series will reportedly focus on Dawood Ibrahim's early life, as well as his gang members and other contemporary mob bosses.\n\nShah Rukh Khan's production house Red Chillies Entertainment released a Netflix film titled Class of '83, starring Bobby Deol and directed by Atul Sabharwal, based on Zaidi's book of the same name.\n\nGangubai Kathiawadi is an upcoming Indian Hindi-language biographical crime film directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and produced by Bhansali Productions in conjunction with Jayantilal Gada's Pen India Ltd.

                "document": "The book is told in a casual style, similar to the authors' previous works, Is Paris Burning? and O Jerusalem!.\n\nContent\nThe book provides a detailed account of the last year of the British Raj; the reactions of princely states towards independence, including descriptions of the colourful and extravagant lifestyles of the Indian princes; the partition of British India (into India and Pakistan) on religious grounds; and the bloodshed that followed.\n\nThere is a description of Shimla, the British summertime capital in the Himalayas, and how supplies were carried up steep mountains by porters each year. Also covered in detail are the events leading to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, as well as the life and motives of Jawaharlal Nehru and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.\n\nRegarding partition, the book—providing maps of Punjab, Bengal, and Kashmir—relates that the crucial maps setting the boundary separating India and Pakistan were drawn that year by Cyril Radcliffe, who had not visited India before being appointed as the chairman of the Boundary Commission. The book depicts the fury of both Hindus and Muslims, misled by their communal leaders, during the partition; and the biggest mass slaughter in the history of India, as millions of people were uprooted by the partition and tried to migrate by train, oxcart, and on foot to new places designated for their particular religious group. Many migrants fell victim to bandits and religious extremists of both dominant religions. One incident quoted describes a canal in Lahore that ran with blood and floating bodies.\n\nBackground\nThe authors interviewed many who were there during the events, including a focus on Lord Mountbatten of Burma. They subsequently wrote a book based in particular upon their research on the British officer, titled Mountbatten and the Partition of India, containing interviews with Mountbatten, and a selection of papers that were in his possession.\n\nResponse \nFreedom at Midnight aroused controversy for its portrayal of the British expatriates, the native rulers of India, and members of India's first cabinet. James Cameron described it as the result of deep research into events often neglected by other historians.\n\nThis book was one of the inspirations for the 2017 film Viceroy's House.\n\nReferences\n\n1975 non-fiction books\nIndian independence movement\nHistory books about India\nBooks about British India\nBooks about foreign relations of the United Kingdom\nWilliam Collins, Sons books"

            "I would like to learn more about the marsileaceae family of ferns. their natural habitats, how many genera and species exist, and their morphology?",
            "Of course! The marsileaceae family, also known as the pepperwort or water-clover family, contains three genera and approximately 50 to 80 species, with most species belonging to the genus marsilea. These ferns are aquatic or semi-aquatic plants and can often be found growing in dense clumps in mud along the shores of ponds or streams. Some of them may even grow submerged in shallow water with some leaves floating on the water surface. They thrive in seasonally wet habitats but can survive winter or dry seasons by losing their leaves and producing desiccation-resistant reproductive structures.\n\nThe three living genera in this family are marsilea, regnellidium, and pilularia. Marsilea is the largest, with 45 to 70 species, and can be distinguished by having four leaflets on each leaf. Regnellidium has only one living species and is characterized by two leaflets per leaf; it is found in southern brazil and neighboring parts of argentina. Pilularia, with around five species, has slender leaves that are often mistaken for grass due to their shape.\n\nIn terms of morphology, these ferns share a few structural characteristics with other ferns but have some unique features too. They have long, slender rhizomes that grow along or beneath the ground, with leaves growing in distinct clusters at nodes. Marsileaceae roots can grow primarily from the same nodes as the leaves or from other locations along the rhizome. Their leaves have a long, slender stalk ending in zero, two, or four (occasionally six) leaflets. Interestingly, vessels found in their roots have evolved independently of vessels in other plant groups."

He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher between 1898 and 1919. After the 1919 season he continued to make periodic appearances as a pinch hitter for many years, until his final game at the age of 57. As a player, Altrock was a member of two World Series winning teams and then, won a third World Series as a coach. He was a coach for the Washington Senators for many years.",

He was one of the better pitchers in baseball for a brief period from  to  with the Chicago White Sox. He was instrumental in the White Sox World Series championship in 1906, going 20–13 with a 2.06 ERA in the regular season and 1–1 with a Series-best 1.00 ERA against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nAn arm injury after 1906 ruined his career, but he hung on with the White Sox and Washington Senators until , though he pitched very little after  and made sporadic pinch-hitting appearances after that, including one in  (facing Rube Walberg of the Philadelphia Athletics) at 57 years of age. He appeared in major league games in five decades, one of only two players to do this (Minnie Miñoso is the other); he is one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in major league games in four decades.\n\nAltrock became a coach for the Senators in  and remained on the Washington staff through , a 42-year skein that represents the longest consecutive-year tenure of a coach with the same franchise in baseball history. Some Senator scorecards continued to list Altrock as a \"coach emeritus\" even after his formal retirement.\n\nDuring that time, he was noted for his antics in the coaching box and teamed with Al Schacht, the \"Clown Prince of Baseball\", for a dozen years to perform comedy routines on baseball fields in the days before official mascots. Schacht and Altrock also took their antics to the vaudeville stage where they appeared in a comedy routine. Ironically, at the height of their collaboration, Schacht and Altrock developed a deep personal animosity and stopped speaking with each other off the field. During their famous comic re-enactments of the Dempsey–Tunney championship boxing match, many speculated that they pulled no punches as they rained blows on each other.\n\nAn anecdote, probably apocryphal, has been printed in some baseball books about a quip by Altrock during his coaching days with the Senators. A batter had hit a ball into the stands and it was not known whether it was fair or foul. The umpire, who had been the target of Altrock's gibes, made the call and shortly afterward a woman was carried from the stands on a litter. The umpire asked Altrock if the ball had hit the woman. In his clear voice, Nick answered, \"No. You called that one right and she passed out from shock.\"\n\nHe was the second oldest position player to play in a major league game when he played in 1924 at the age of 47.\n\nAltrock lived for many years in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C., with his wife Eleanor, and died at age 88 in 1965.

                "title": "Club Sporting Cristal S.A. is a Peruvian sports club located in the city of Lima, best known for its football team. It was founded on 13 December 1955 in the Rímac district by engineer Ricardo Bentín Mujica and his wife Esther Grande de Bentín, owners of the Peruvian brewery Backus and Johnston. The club and the brewery have been closely linked since its inception, and it is for this reason that it is popularly known as los Cerveceros (\"the brewers\").",
                "document": "The team has played in the Primera División since 1956, where it obtained the title that year. Due to this achievement, Cristal is often referred to as \"El club que nació campeón\". Since their first participation, they have won the league title 19 times and are one of the few teams in Peru to have never been relegated from the top division. Sporting Cristal is also the first Peruvian team to have been crowned tricampeóns, successively winning the 1994, 1995, and 1996 seasons. In 1997, they were runners-up of the Copa Libertadores, losing the final to Brazilian side Cruzeiro. Cristal holds the longest undefeated streak in the tournament; 17 games without suffering a loss.\n\nCristal has a heated rivalry with Club Universitario de Deportes. One of the main reasons for the enmity between the two sides is the series of transfers of Universitario's star players to los Celestes. The club also has rivalries with Alianza Lima, Deportivo Municipal, and Sport Boys.\n\nSporting Cristal plays its home games at the Estadio Alberto Gallardo. They play at the Estadio Nacional for international competitions such as the Libertadores or Sudamericana. The Estadio Nacional is also the venue for matches against Universitario and Alianza Lima.\n\nIn addition to football, the club has teams specializing in futsal, women's football, and volleyball.\n\nHistory\nRicardo Bentín Mujica, with the support of his wife, co-owners of Backus and Johnston brewery, was the man who is credited with achieving the company's goal. A club from Rímac ward, known as Sporting Tabaco founded in 1926 and originally belonging to the tobacco growers' union, was already playing in the professional Peruvian First Division.  Never having won a national championship, the club was in dire economic straits.  Bentín decided to buy the club and search for a playing ground, so that the club could develop and be able to play better at the professional level. The club found a lot in the neighborhood of La Florida of 137,000 m².\n\nOn December 13, 1955 the club was founded as Sporting Cristal , after Backus' best-known beer brand, Cristal. The new club from the Rímac ward debuted in 1956 in the professional Primera Division and won their first national title that same year. Journalists thus called them the club born a champion (nació campeon). The team managed to win more titles over the years and was known as one of the best football clubs in Peru after Universitario and Alianza Lima. A few years later, the club eliminated the word Backus from their name to demonstrate their economic independence.\n\nDuring the 1962 edition until the 1969 edition of the Copa Libertadores, Sporting Cristal went on an 17-game undefeated streak, the longest unbeaten streak in the Copa Libertadores, winning 8 games, and tying 9.\n\nSporting Cristal changed its shirt color from blue to light blue. They are known as \"Los Celestes\". During a brief period between 1978 and 1981, they again used blue shirts. In 1982 they returned to light blue as the color of the club.\n\nThe 1990s were the most successful decade as they claimed 4 national titles (including 3 in a row) with coach Juan Carlos Oblitas. Under Oblitas, Cristal won 1991, 1994 and 1995 domestic league. Then, guided by Sergio Markarián head coach they won 1996 league. By 1997, the team, led by Uruguayan coach Sergio Markarián, reached the finals of the Copa Libertadores, where they faced the Brazilian club Cruzeiro. The first leg was a home game, in which they ended in a scoreless draw; in the second leg, they lost 1–0. This is the closest Team Peru has come to the Copa Libertadores Final since 1972, when Universitario had a similar fate playing against Independiente."

It was established on june 22, 1564, by rené goulaine de laudonnière as a territorial claim in french florida and as a safe haven for huguenots, who were being persecuted in france due to their protestant faith.\n\nThe french colony faced problems with hunger, desertion, and conflicts with the spanish, who had also established st. Augustine in september 1565. On september 20, 1565, fort caroline was sacked by spanish troops under pedro menéndez de avilés. The spanish continued to occupy the site as san mateo until 1569. The exact site of the former fort is unknown, but in 1953, the national park service established the fort caroline national memorial along the southern bank of the st. John's river near the point that commemorates laudonnière's first landing.\n\nThe history of fort caroline is intertwined with earlier french expeditions, such as charlesfort and jean ribault's exploration, which led to encounters with the timucuans and attempts at establishing new settlements. Fort caroline existed for just over a year and faced difficulties with its relations with native populations, having to rely heavily on the timucuans for food and trade. The french even participated in attacks on rival native villages, which contributed to the fort's eventual downfall. The memorial is now part of the timucuan ecological and historic preserve and managed by the national park service."

This is generally accepted by scholars as being in the vicinity of the original fort, though probably not the exact location. The memorial is now managed as a part of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, but it is also a distinct unit under administration of the National Park Service.\n\nHistory\n\nCharlesfort (1562-1563, 1577-1578)\n\nA French expedition, organized by Protestant leader Admiral Gaspard de Coligny and led by the French Explorer Jean Ribault, had landed at the site on the May River (now the St. Johns River) in February 1562. Here Ribault encountered the Timucuans led by Chief Saturiwa. Ribault took some 28 troops north along the coast, where on present-day Parris Island, South Carolina they developed a settlement known as Charlesfort. Ribault returned to Europe to arrange supplies for the new colony. When he was captured and briefly imprisoned in England on suspicion of spying related to the French Wars of Religion, he was prevented from returning to Florida.\n\nAfter a year without supplies or leadership, and beset by hostility from the native populations, all but one of the colonists left Charlesfort to sail back to Europe. During their voyage in an open boat, they were reduced to cannibalism before the survivors were rescued in English waters. Another French force reestablished a fort at the site in 1577–1578.\n\nFort Caroline (1564–1565)\n\nMeanwhile, René Goulaine de Laudonnière, who had been Ribault's second-in-command on the 1562 expedition, led a contingent of around 200 new settlers back to Florida, where they founded Fort Caroline (or Fort de la Caroline) on June 22, 1564; the site was on a small plain formed by the western slope of the high steep bank later called St. Johns Bluff.  The fort was named for King Charles IX of France. For just over a year, this settlement was beset by hunger and desertion, and attracted the attention of Spanish authorities who considered it a challenge to their control over the area.\n\nThe French colonists \"had to rely heavily on the Indians\" for both food and trade. The Timucua welcomed them. French soldiers also traveled across Timucuan territory, encountering the Yustaga people and unsuccessfully seeking gold and silver mines.  Timucua chief Outina twice \"coaxed the French into participating in attacks on villages of his rival, [the] Potano, to seize surplus corn.\" French soldiers who deserted from the fort raided  Timucua settlements, souring relations with them."

westwards after a failed attempt to reinforce the besieged French garrison in Egypt \n Although Hallowell immediately recognised the danger his vessel was in and turned to flee , the French ships were much faster and soon closed with his ship \n At 14 : 00 , three French vessels were within long gunshot and Hallowell decided that his only hope of escape lay in disabling the three ships before the rest of the French squadron could join the engagement \n Turning towards the enemy , Hallowell found that his sluggish ship was unable to respond rapidly to French manoeuvres and within two hours Swiftsure was surrounded \n Threatened with complete destruction and unable to escape , the British captain surrendered \n \n\n The action was a rare victory for the French in the Mediterranean Sea , which had been largely under British control since the French Mediterranean Fleet had been destroyed in 1798 at the Battle of the Nile \n This had trapped the French army in Egypt on the African side of the Mediterranean , and all efforts to reinforce and resupply them had ended in failure , including three separate expeditions by Ganteaume 's squadron \n Swiftsure was later commissioned into the French Navy and fought at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 , where the ship was recaptured by the British and rejoined the Royal Navy \n Hallowell was subsequently court martialed for the loss of his

Nelson destroyed the French Mediterranean Fleet at Aboukir Bay on the Egyptian coast \n The battle completely reversed the strategic situation in the Mediterranean : British forces had evacuated the region in 1796 after the Treaty of San Ildefonso brought Spain into the war on the French side , but they were now able to return in large numbers \n As French maritime lines of communication were cut , the French Armée d 'Orient under General Napoleon Bonaparte became trapped in Egypt \n Unable to return to Europe by sea , the army attempted and failed to pass overland through Palestine and was subsequently abandoned by Bonaparte , who returned to France with his closest advisors in the frigates Muiron and Carrère in November 1799 , promising to send reinforcements to the forces that remained in North Africa \n \n\n By 1801 , the Armée d 'Orient was on the verge of collapse \n No supplies or support had arrived from France , their commander Jean Baptiste Kléber had been assassinated , and a British invasion was impending \n Frustrated at his failure to assist his men in Egypt , Bonaparte ordered a squadron of ships of the line to sail from Brest in January 1801 under the command of Contre-Amiral Honoré Ganteaume \n This force was instructed to sail to the Eastern Mediterranean and land over 5 @,@ 000 troops at Alexandria \n In February , Ganteaume 's force reached Toulon , the admiral concerned that his ships would be outnumbered further east where the British expeditionary force was gathering \n Bonaparte sent him back to sea to complete the operation but again he returned , driven back by bad weather and a patrolling British squadron off Sicily under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren \n On 27 April Ganteaume made a third attempt to reach Egypt ,

The plot serves as a prequel to the first game (SpellForce: The Order of Dawn), depicting events that lead to the creation of The Circle, the group of mages whose actions were the basis for The Order of Dawn.",
                "document": "The game combines role-playing and real-time strategy elements like previous games in the series. Players control a mage called Tahar and a group of supporting characters with different backstories and abilities. Like many role-playing games, characters can equip various items such as armor, weapons and jewelry that influence the character's abilities and traits. Many maps allow players to construct buildings and gather resources to create additional units with fixed abilities. The game features an extensive campaign that can be played by a single player or two players. It also includes a skirmish mode allowing players to battle against the AI or other players, independently of the campaign.\n\nTwo standalone expansions were released for SpellForce 3, Soul Harvest (2018) and Fallen God (2020), as well as a free multiplayer-only version called SpellForce 3: Versus. On 6 December 2021, an upgraded version of the original, SpellForce 3 Reforced was released for Microsoft Windows, and due to release for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 8 March 2022.\n\nGameplay \nSpellForce 3 is a role-playing video game with real-time strategy game elements. Usually, players control a character they created and up to three companions, each with different abilities. Like many role-playing games, these characters can be customized by equipping them with different items such as weapons, armor and jewelry which influence their various abilities and effectiveness in battle. Some maps require players to construct a base of operations and specialized buildings to gather resources and recruit units to defeat larger groups of enemies or fulfill certain tasks.\n\nThe game features a story-driven campaign and a skirmish mode which allows players to fight battles on the game's maps without previously playing through the campaign mode. Both modes can be played alone or with other players online. In skirmish mode, players can share responsibilities of managing a single race with others.\n\nPlayers can create their own character in campaign mode, customizing appearance and gender. They can also choose three different skill trees, depending on the chosen fighting style. All player-created characters have a fourth skill tree called \"Leadership\" which contains skills related to the real-time strategy parts of the game. Each character has five attributes (strength, dexterity, intelligence, willpower and constitution) which influence what weapons, armor and items they can use as well their health, focus, damage, block and critical strike chances. During the campaign, a number of other characters (companions) can be recruited . All characters gain experience points by killing enemies and completing quests, regardless of whether they were involved in combat or the quest. Experience points allow players to unlock improvements for their character and companions, such as learning new skills, improving attributes and unlocking advanced equipment.\n\nThe game uses an isometric perspective that players can rotate to display the environment. Depending on the map, players control a single character or a group. The mouse, along with hotkeys, can be used for actions such as selecting enemies to attack or skills to use. Alternatively, selecting an enemy and holding a certain key will slow down the game and shows a wheel of possible skills to use on the unit. The skill-wheel was added for the first time in the SpellForce series in SpellForce 3 and allows players to quickly select and perform an action."

The game is set in the pseudo-medieval kingdom of Ehb, 150 years after the events of Dungeon Siege and follows descendants of survivors of the 10th Legion in their quest to reestablish their military force.",
                "document": "The game employs classical role-playing elements in a high fantasy setting. Players control one of four characters, with one of the other three either controlled by the computer or another player using multiplayer features. When playing in single-player mode, players can readily switch out the supporting character at any time but unlike previous games in the series, only one companion character can be in the game at one time. Dungeon Siege III features an extensive set of items such as armor, weapons and jewelry that can be used to influence the characters' abilities and traits with each character having their own unique set of clothing, armor and weapons. \n\nDungeon Siege III  was announced in June 2010 as the first main entry in the series not to be developed by Gas Powered Games following a purchase of the rights to the series by Square Enix earlier that year. The game was instead developed by Obsidian Entertainment with Chris Taylor, the inventor of the Dungeon Siege franchise, serving as an adviser. The game received mixed reviews by critics who praised the game's mechanics and graphics, especially the character models. Opinions about the story, replay value and multiplayer system were mixed on the other hand.\n\nGameplay\nDungeon Siege III is an action role-playing game that takes place in a fantasy medieval world with geographic variety in open and closed environments (dungeons). The game displays the game world from an isometric (top-down) perspective and uses a display engine that makes the entire experience seamless by constantly loading required game scenes in the background. This way, the game does not need any load screens often found in other games. The game also avoids using many cut scenes by having characters talk to each other while traveling.\n\nThe game features a control system created to accommodate the parallel release on consoles as well as on the PC. As such, unlike previous games in the series, Dungeon Siege III no longer features an automatic targeting system and point-and-click mechanics. Instead, the player moves their character using the keyboard or a controller and the screen will move to stay centered on the character. To fight, player have to point the character in the direction of the enemies they want to engage and press the attack button. \n\nPlayers control one of four predefined characters chosen at the beginning of the game. The other three appear as non-player characters (NPCs). In single-player mode only one of computer-controlled NPCs accompanies the player character at any given time, although the active companion can be changed at any time. This distinguishes the game from previous Dungeon Siege titles, where multiple characters could be in the game at the same time. If either the player or their companion die, they can be revived by the surviving character. If both die, the game has to be restarted from the last location it was saved. The AI is programmed to effectively use a companion's skills to complement the player, such as by waiting for the right time to use abilities or only attempting to revive the player when no more enemies are in the area. \n\nEach character has two fighting stances to handle different situations. For example, the character of Lucas can wield a two-handed sword to damage a lot of enemies at once but with less protection, or use a one-handed sword and shield to fight against single strong enemies or to block attacks. In addition, there are three different special abilities for each stance that require \"focus\", the game's equivalent to magic points, to use. The amount of focus required varies based on the ability used. Each of those abilities has an improved version available after meeting certain conditions, such as using the skill a certain number of times. There are also three different passive abilities (such as healing, increased armor etc.). The improved versions of the attack abilities and the passive abilities use a different system of power spheres. All improved and passive abilities will deplete such a sphere. Both the focus points and the spheres are refilled by fighting enemies. While amount of focus available will always be a maximum of 100%, the player will start with only one sphere and gain three additional ones at key points of the plot, regardless of their level or experience points. Additionally, players collect experience points for defeating enemies and completing quests which in turn increase the character's level. At each new level, the player can choose to improve one of ten different beneficial effects for the character, such as improved attacks, bonus effects when being hit etc. \n\nOn the console versions, a second player can control the companion character using a second controller at the same device. Additionally, using the online multiplayer feature, up to four players can play the campaign together, with the difficulty being adjusted accordingly. However, since players can join and leave at any time, the game will only save progress for the player who initiated the game, not the other players. If a player leave or goes inactive, the game's AI will take over. When multiple players play together, they can vote on which quests to accept or how to handle different story-related decisions. Throughout the game, the game asks the player to make decisions using a wheel-like interface reminiscent of the Mass Effect series that can affect events later in the game.\n\nEach of the four characters features nine unique sets of equipment, meaning that (with the exception of rings) no piece of equipment can be used by any of the other characters. Items can be obtained as a reward for winning fights, looted from fallen enemies and bought with gold, the game's currency, from vendors, special non-player characters that can be found in various locations."

            "Is skogskyrkogården an important cemetery in stockholm, and what is its history?",
            "Yes, skogskyrkogården is an important cemetery located in the gamla enskede district, south of central stockholm, sweden. It is a unesco world heritage site and a major tourist attraction, with a design representing the transition from nordic classicism to mature functionalism in architecture. The cemetery was created following an international competition in 1915, which was won by the architects gunnar asplund and sigurd lewerentz with their design named \"tallum.\" work on the cemetery began in 1917 on an area that used to be old gravel quarries overgrown with pine trees.\n\nThe design of skogskyrkogården was inspired by the german forest cemeteries friedhof ohlsdorf in hamburg and waldfriedhof in munich and neoclassical paintings by caspar david friedrich. The cemetery consists of a long route starting from the ornamental colonnaded entrance and splitting into two paths, one leading through a pastoral landscape and the other towards a granite cross and the abstract portico of the crematorium and chapels. The paths eventually rejoin and lead to the \"uppståndelsekapellet\" or resurrection chapel, through a dense grove of tall pine trees.\n\nThe architects designed the entire complex, including landscape and details like lamps, integrating sculptures by carl milles. Lewerentz mainly focused on the landscape, while asplund primarily worked on the buildings. The small woodland crematorium, built in 1935-40, is considered a key part of both asplund's oeuvre and the nordic classicism style.",
            "That's really interesting, especially about the design and inspiration behind it. resurrection chapel and the involvement of gunnar asplund and sigurd lewerentz in the project?",
            "Certainly! The resurrection chapel, also known as \"uppståndelsekapellet,\" is a classical structure built in 1925 and was one of the key contributions of sigurd lewerentz to the skogskyrkogården cemetery. The architectural style of the chapel is influenced by a primitive hut that asplund had seen in a garden at liselund.\n\nThe chapel features a tuscan peristyle and a gold statue on its roof, which was created by carl milles. Asplund and lewerentz's partnership on this project allowed each architect to focus on their respective strengths. While lewerentz's main contribution revolved around the landscape, the main entrance, and the resurrection chapel, asplund dedicated his efforts to the buildings within the complex.\n\nThe collaboration proved fruitful, as the skogskyrkogården cemetery is now considered a masterpiece combining elements of nordic classicism and mature functionalism in architecture. Asplund's work on the woodland crematorium, which houses the chapels of the holy cross, faith, and hope, is another important aspect of the project. The crematorium showcases a rational modernist style, reflecting asplund's later work and marking his final architectural contribution before his death in 1940.\n\nBoth architects had a significant impact on cemetery design worldwide due to the tranquil beauty they created by blending the natural landscape with their architectural designs at skogskyrkogården."

                "document": "History\n\nSkogskyrkogården came about following an international competition in 1915 for the design of a new cemetery in Enskede in the southern part of Stockholm, Sweden. The entry called \"Tallum\" by the young architects Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz was selected. After changes made to the design on the recommendations of the competition jury, work began in 1917 on land that had been old gravel quarries that were overgrown with pine trees, and the first phase was completed three years later. The architects' use of the natural landscape created an extraordinary environment of tranquil beauty that had a profound influence on cemetery design throughout the world. Essential models for the design of the cemetery were the German forest cemeteries of Friedhof Ohlsdorf at Hamburg and Waldfriedhof in Munich but also the neoclassical paintings of Caspar David Friedrich.\n\nThe basis for the route through the cemetery is a long route leading from the ornamental colonnaded entrance that then splits, one way leading through a pastoral landscape, complete with a large pond and a tree-lined meditation hill, and the other up to a large detached granite cross and the abstract portico of the crematorium and the chapels of the Holy Cross, Faith, and Hope. The paths then rejoin and pass along a dead-straight path through a dense grove of tall pine trees, the so-called Way of Seven Wells, leading to the \"Uppståndelsekapellet\" or Resurrection Chapel. The giant dark granite cross at the focus of the vista from the main entrance has also been described as having been based on a painting by Caspar David Friedrich, titled \"Cross on the Baltic Sea\" (1815), signifying hope in an abandoned world; yet Asplund and Lewerentz insisted that the cross was open to non-Christian interpretations, even quoting Friedrich: \"To those who see it as such, a consolation, to those who do not, simply a cross.\"\n\nThe architects designed the entire complex, from the landscape to the smallest lamp, though there are also integrated sculptures by Carl Milles. Lewerentz's contribution mainly concerned the landscape but also the main entrance and the classical \"Uppståndelsekapellet\" or Resurrection Chapel, which was built in 1925. Asplund devoted himself mainly to the buildings, and the small Woodland Crematorium – built in 1935–40 – has been regarded as a central work in his oeuvre as well as the Nordic Classicism style of that period. The small chapel, set on a Tuscan peristyle and featuring a gold statue on the roof by Carl Milles, was in fact derived from a \"primitive hut\" that Asplund had happened to see in a garden at Liselund. The crematorium, with its Faith, Hope, and Holy Cross Chapels, was Asplund's final work of architecture, designed in a rational modernist style typical for his later work, opened shortly before his death in 1940.\n\nIn 1994, Skogskyrkogården was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site and although it does not have the number of famous interments as the Norra begravningsplatsen, its much older counterpart in northern Stockholm, it is a major tourist attraction. At the Tallum Pavilion (a building designed originally by Asplund as staff facilities), visitors can see an exhibition about the cemetery and the story of its origins and the two architects whose vision created it.\n\nSkogskyrkogården is connected to a metro station by the same name (see Skogskyrkogården metro station).\n\nNotable interments\n Artur Adson, (1889–1977), Estonian poet, writer and theatre critic (location)\n Gunnar Asplund (1885–1940), architect (location)\n Tim Bergling (1989–2018), musician and DJ, known professionally as Avicii (funeral here, remains buried at Hedvig Eleonora Churchyard) \n Brasse Brännström (1945–2014), actor\n Ulla Bergryd (1942–2015), actress and Stockholm University's lecturer\n Arthur Fischer (1897–1991), actor\n Siegfried Fischer (1894–1976), actor\n Gustav Fonandern (1880–1960), architect, singer (location)\n Greta Garbo (1905–1990), actress (location)\n Alma Johansson (1880–1974), missionary (location)\n Pelle Lindbergh (1959–1985),  hockey goaltender with Team Sweden and the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL\n Ivar Lo-Johansson (1901–1990), writer (location)\n Oscar A.C.

Before the widespread development of public parks, the rural cemetery provided a place for the general public to enjoy outdoor recreation amidst art and sculpture previously available only for the wealthy.\n\nThe popularity of rural cemeteries decreased toward the end of the 1800s due to the high cost of maintenance, development of true public parks and perceived disorderliness of appearance due to independent ownership of family burial plots and different grave markers. Lawn cemeteries became instead an attractive design.\n\nHistory\n\nIn the early 19th century, urban burial grounds were generally sectarian and located on small plots and churchyards within cities.  With the rapid increase in urban populations due to the Industrial Revolution, urban cemeteries became unhealthily overcrowded with graves stacked upon each other, or emptied and reused for newer burials.  The practice of embalming did not become popular until after the Civil War and cemeteries often had the stench of decomposing corpses.  After several yellow fever epidemics, many cities began to relocate cemeteries outside city limits, as it was believed to be more hygienic.\n\nAs early as 1711, the architect Sir Christopher Wren advocated for the creation of burial grounds on the outskirts of town, \"inclosed with a strong Brick Wall, and having a walk round, and two cross walks, decently planted with Yew-trees\".\n\nAn early influence on the Rural Cemetery movement was the New Burying Ground in New Haven, Connecticut (later named Grove Street Cemetery).  The New Burying Ground was established in 1796, and was the first example in the U.S. of a non-sectarian cemetery outside of church and city control in a park-like setting.\n\nIn 1804, the first rural cemetery, the Père Lachaise Cemetery, opened in Paris. The new design took the cemetery out of the control of the church, using an attractive park built on a grand scale, architectural design and careful planting inspired by the English garden movement.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe first rural cemetery in the United States was Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, founded by Dr. Jacob Bigelow and Henry Dearborn of The Massachusetts Horticultural Society in 1831. The City of Boston became concerned about the health hazards caused by decomposing corpses in cemeteries in the middle of the city.  A citizens' group led by Bigelow pulled together residents to discuss the design and location of a cemetery outside city limits.  The search for a site took six years and land was eventually purchased on a farm known as Sweet Auburn along the Charles River about four miles from Boston.\n\nCoinciding with the growing popularity of horticulture and the Romantic aesthetic taste for pastoral beauty, Mount Auburn was developed as a \"domesticated landscape\" popularized by 19th century English landscape design. Its plan included retention of natural features like ponds and mature forests with added roads and paths that followed the natural contours of the land, as well as the planting of hundreds of native and exotic trees and plants. United States Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story delivered the dedication address on September 24, 1831.\n\nMount Auburn also began the practice of allowing the purchase of family plots large enough to allow the burial of several generations of a single family.\n\nMount Auburn quickly grew as a popular site for both burials and public recreation, attracting locals as well as tourists from across the country and Europe."

                "document": "In 2007, Bindeez was subject to a multi-national product recall after it was found that the Wangqi Product Factory in Shenzhen, China had, in some shipped toys, used a cheap chemical that was a pharmacologically active sedative prodrug instead of the safer chemical specified by the designers, resulting in the illness and hospitalization of some children who ingested the beads. Since then, safer replacements have been marketed.\n\nDescription \n\nBindeez contains a craft kit that allows children to create various multi-dimensional designs using small colored beads.  \"Bindeez\" can refer to either the toy itself or the small beads. The beads are arranged into various designs on a plastic tray. When the beads are sprayed with water, their surfaces become adhesive and they fuse together. The beads are then left to dry and the whole design becomes fixed and can be removed from the tray.\n\nThe beads are approximately five millimetres in diameter and come in a wide range of colours. Bindeez are available in various different kits with accessories such as a drying fan, applicator pen, design templates for the beads, and water spray bottles. The product is labelled for ages four and above.\n\n2007 recall\n\nBindeez were first withdrawn from the Australian market, and subsequently from the North American market by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission as well as European markets in early November 2007. They were recalled in Australia after a two-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl became seriously ill after they swallowed large numbers of the beads and the connection between the illness and the product was discovered by a doctor at The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney. Two children in North America became unconscious after similar ingestion. U.S. safety officials recalled about 4.2 million of the toys.\n\nThe toy was supposed to contain the non-toxic plasticiser 1,5-pentanediol, but instead contained toxic 1,4-butanediol, which is metabolised into the sedative-hypnotic drug gamma-hydroxybutyric acid. At the time the substitution was discovered, the non-toxic ingredient was three to seven times more expensive than the toxic one. The affected children had seizure-like activity, which is an occasional side-effect of severe GHB overdose. Concern has been raised in the press that people may intentionally eat the beads in order to get high, potentially spawning a black market in the recalled toy.\n\nThe Australian distributor has claimed that the medical emergencies \"did not result in any long-term effects.\"\n\nThe issue was the topic of the second episode of the third season of Elementary, a Sherlock Holmes remake that aired on 6 November 2014.  The episode was entitled \"The Five Orange Pipz\".  The murderer was attempting to market the beads after they would be released from evidence.\n\nA similar Japanese product, Aquabeads, which was developed in Japan by Epoch Co. Ltd, and is produced by a different Chinese manufacturer, has not been recalled and is uncontaminated.\n\nIn Australia, replacement beads were available from March 2008 onwards, based on the interim ban being lifted. The replacement beads will be manufactured using only approved ingredients. To discourage ingestion, the replacement beads will also be coated with the bitter-tasting substance known as Bitrex. The name of the product was also changed from Bindeez to Beados in an attempt to extinguish the link between the recall of the old toy and the new toy.\n\nIn North America, the beads, previously marketed as \"Aquadots\", were remarketed as Pixos and marketed as \"Safety Tested\" in the television commercial as the commercial began hitting the airways in early July. However, the background music is exactly the same.  In June 2009, \"Chixos\" featuring dolls began marketing more towards girls.\n\nAwards\nBindeez was awarded Australian \"Toy of the Year\" for 2007. Toy Wishes magazine named it as one of the products among its 12 best toys of 2007. It is manufactured in China for the Australian-owned company Moose Enterprise P/L, and distributed in North America by Spin Master Ltd.  It is distributed in 40 countries, and 12 million packets, containing more than 8 billion beads, have been sold worldwide.\n\nSee also\n2007 Chinese export recalls\nToy safety\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial Beados website\n\nArt and craft toys\n2000s toys\nToy recalls\nToy controversies"

Flying Buffalo Inc. pioneered the first commercially available PBM game in 1970.

                "document": "Play-by-mail games—becoming known as \"turn-based games\" in the digital age—have a number of advantages and disadvantages compared to other gaming genres. PBM games have wide ranges for turn lengths. Some games allow turnaround times of a day or less. Other games structure multiple days or weeks for players to consider moves or turns and players never run out of opponents to face. If desired, some PBM games can be played for years. Additionally, the complexity of PBM games can be far beyond that allowed by a board game in an afternoon, and pit players against live opponents in these conditions—a challenge some players enjoy. PBM games allow the number of opponents or teams in the dozens—with some previous examples over a thousand players. PBM games also allow gamers to interact with others globally. Games with low turn costs compare well with expensive board or video games. Drawbacks include the price for some PBM games with high setup and/or turn costs, and the lack of the ability for face-to-face roleplaying. Additionally, for some players, certain games can be overly complex, and delays in turn processing can be a negative.\n\nPlay-by-mail games are multifaceted. In their earliest form they involved two players mailing each other directly by postal mail, such as in correspondence chess. Multi-player games, such as Diplomacy or more complex games available today, involve a game master who receives and processes orders and adjudicates turn results for players. These games also introduced the element of diplomacy in which participants can discuss gameplay with each other, strategize, and form alliances. In the 1970s and 1980s, some games involved turn results adjudicated completely by humans. Over time, partial or complete turn adjudication by computer became the norm. Games also involve open- and closed-end variants. Open-ended games do not normally end and players can develop their positions to the fullest extent possible; in closed-end games, players pursue victory conditions until a game conclusion. PBM games enable players to explore a diverse array of roles, such as characters in fantasy or medieval settings, space operas, inner city gangs, or more unusual ones such as assuming the role of a microorganism or monster.\n\nHistory\n\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using postal mail. Chess and Go are among the oldest examples of this. In these two-player games, players sent moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later: Diplomacy is an early example of this type, emerging in 1963, in which a central game master manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. According to Shannon Appelcline, there was some PBM play in the 1960s, but not much."

        "answer": "Playtex's origins can be traced back to 1932 when Abram Nathaniel Spanel founded its predecessor, the International Latex Corporation (ILC)[1]. Initially, ILC produced latex products such as bathing caps, swimwear, and baby pants[1]. In 1940, they introduced the living girdle, after inventing a patented method for manufacturing latex girdles that wouldn't tear at the seams[1]. However, the solid rubber girdle was quite uncomfortable to wear despite its advertising[1]. During World War II, the company almost went bankrupt due to the shortage of latex supplies[1]. To survive, ILC founded an industrial division to develop government and military applications for latex[1]. In 1947, ILC reorganized into four divisions, one of which was Playtex[1]. The name playtex is a combination of \"play\" and \"latex,\" reflecting its focus on latex products[1]. Playtex's marketing led to a shift from custom-tailored undergarments to mass-produced sizes[1]. Playtex introduced fitting charts and floor displays, allowing women to find the right size without custom fittings[1]. In 1955, Playtex became the first company to advertise undergarments on network television[1] and continued to innovate through the years. In the 1960s, Playtex introduced tampons, becoming the main competitor to Tampax[1]. They patented the first plastic tampon applicator in 1973[1]. Over the years, Playtex went through several acquisitions and divisions, ultimately splitting into Playtex Apparel Inc. and Playtex Products LLC[1]. Playtex apparel was eventually sold to Sara Lee in 1991 and later to HanesBrands in 2007[1]."

There were turtle and seabird interactions in the deep set fishery also, but these were one to two orders of magnitude lower than in the shallow set fishery.\n\nSeabird Bycatch Mitigation Development \n\nPrior to 2001, 1380 black footed albatross and 1163 Laysan albatrosses were caught annually by the Hawaii longline fishery.  The WPRFMC's response to the volume of seabirds being caught was to mount a project through 1998 and 1999 to test various seabird mitigation methods. It was found that during gear setting operations, blue dyed baits were the most successful mitigation method, followed by strategic offal discards. Tori lines and a towed buoy system also proved to be effective mitigation measures during the set. During hauling operations, blue dyed baited and tori lines were found to be equally effective mitigation strategies, followed by the towed buoy. Retaining offal on the vessel during the haul increased seabird interactions.\n\nThe National Marine Fisheries Service Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (NMFS PIFSC) also tested tori lines, blue dyed bait and weighted hooks in 1999, They found that baits dyed blue and baits with additional weight reduced the number of interactions with both black-footed and Laysan albatross. Tori lines reduced contact between baits and albatrosses by 70%\n\nThe WPRFMC's plan for implementing seabird mitigation measures was for an Fishery Management Plan(FMP) amendment where fishermen could choose the measures from a selected list of proven mitigation methods. However, this was forestalled by a 2000 US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinion (BiOp) on the endangered Short-tailed albatross  in, which prescribed what seabird mitigation measures would be used by the tuna-targeting (deep sets) and by swordfish (shallow sets) as follows:\n\nSummary of seabird deterrent measures by set type \n\nThe WPRFMC incorporated these measures into a Pelagics FMP amendment in 2002, requiring that these seabird mitigation measures be used when fishing north of 23 deg N. This measure was further refined in 2006 by an FMP amendment that allowed operators of Hawaii-based longline vessels fishing north of 23 degrees north latitude, as well as those targeting swordfish south of 23 degrees north, to utilize side-setting to reduce seabird interactions in lieu of the seabird mitigation already measures required.\n\nThe implementation of the seabird measures caused a massive drop in seabird interactions by more than 90% in the Hawaii longline fishery.\n\nSea Turtle Bycatch Mitigation Development \n\nDespite low observer coverage, usually 5% or less, it was estimated that prior to 2001, a total of 666 turtles were caught annually in the Hawaii longline fishery: 418 loggerheads, 146 olive ridleys, 112 leatherbacks and 40 green turtles.\n\nUnlike the seabird issue, the solutions for sea turtles were propelled initially by litigation by environmental organizations which resulted in a complete closure of the shallow set longline fishery between 2001 and 2004. Over these years, the Hawaii fishery was only permitted to target tunas. An FMP amendment in 2002 incorporated reasonable and prudent alternative of the March 2001 Biological Opinion issued by NMFS.  This amendment prohibited shallow set pelagic longlining north of the equator and closed waters between 0° and 15° N from April–May annually to longline fishing. It instituted sea turtle handling requirements for all vessels using hooks to target pelagic species in the region's EEZ waters and extended the protected species workshop requirement to include the operators of vessels registered to longline general permits\n\nSalvation was at hand, however, for the shallow-set longline fishery, based on hook research by NMFS Fisheries Engineering Laboratory in Pascagoula, Mississippi. This research found that large 18/0 circle hooks combined with mackerel type fish bait could sharply reduce loggerhead and leatherback interactions of longline vessels fishing on the Grand Banks for swordfish. The WPRFMC operationalized this technology in an FMP amendment which established a limited Hawaii-based shallow-set swordfish fishery using circle hooks with mackerel bait."

                "title": "Capitella teleta is a small, cosmopolitan, segmented annelid worm. It is a well-studied invertebrate, which has been cultured for use in laboratories for over 30 years. C. teleta is the first marine polychaete to have its genome sequenced.",
                "document": "Description\n\nInitial discovery \nFor many years researchers believed that Capitella capitata was the only representative of this genus that survived, and flourished, in polluted environments. After the oil spill that occurred near Cape Cod in West Falmouth, Massachusetts in 1969, researchers collected sediment and found an abundance of what they believed to be C. capitata. However, subsequent research showed that while the individuals collected from that region had very similar gross morphology, their life histories, methods of reproduction and genetics indicated there were at least six distinct species. Capitella species I, eventually described as Capitella teleta in 2009, was one of the initial species identified from these surveys.\n\nEtymology \nAfter 30 years of research on the group, Capitella teleta was officially described in 2009 by Blake et al. The species name is derived from the Greek word teleta, meaning \"initiation\". This word symbolizes that it was the first alternative Capitella species that was identified.\n\nPhylogenetics \nA 2018 molecular phylogeny of the family Capitellidae established clear monophyly and showed 8 genera. The phylogeny utilized 36 capitellid species and  combined data from 18S, 28S, H3, and COI gene sequences. This study also established Capitellidae as the sister group to Echiura. While the study attempted to map morphological characters to the molecular phylogeny, this was not phylogenetically informative and a more detailed re-evaluation of morphology could help to elucidate character trait evolution.\n\nTaxonomic morphology \nCapitella teleta has a narrow, segmented body with reduced parapodia and is red in color. There are nine anterior thoracic segments and many more abdominal segments. New segments are added throughout the lifespan from a posterior subterminal growth zone, called the posterior growth zone. Like other polychaetes, C. teleta has fine bristles or setae. Setae are segmentally repeated along the body, with morphologically distinct setae in the thoracic (hooded hooks) and abdominal segments (capillary setae). This animal exhibits sexual dimorphism and males have dorsally-positioned genital spines on setigers 8-9 while females have paired ovaries in the abdominal segments. Generally, there are separate sexes, however, hermaphroditism is possible when there are low densities of females. Males, females and hermaphrodites are of similar size (max size collected was a male that is 24 mm in length).\n\nEcology\n\nHabitat \nCapitella teleta lives in the shallow-water or intertidal marine environment. It is also found in salt marshes and is often found in high concentrations in disturbed soft sediments. It is a member of the infaunal benthic community. C. teleta burrows through the sediment by peristalsis, using its hydrostatic skeleton and contraction of longitudinal and circular muscles in the body wall. The thoracic segments of C. teleta also contain helical muscles that are proposed to generate additional force for burrowing. Capitellids are commonly thought of as opportunistic in nature, due to their ability to inhabit and flourish in organically enriched marine sediments.\n\nThis organism is commonly found in sediments along the east and west coasts of North America. Additional reports have placed this group in the Mediterranean region as well as Japan.\n\nLife history \nCapitella teleta embryos and early larval stages develop in a brood tube that surrounds the mother. The embryos are approximately 200 µm in diameter. Over the course of approximately a week, the embryos develop into non-feeding larvae which form musculature, a centralized nervous system, two circular ciliary bands, two eye spots, segments, and setae. The larvae are non-feeding and the digestive system develops at a later stage than other organs.  Pre-metamorphosis larvae can be categorized into nine stages, with each stage lasting approximately one day. Upon further body elongation and gut maturation, the larvae emerge from the brood tube, and swim forward with a rotational turn via the beating of cilia organized within two circular bands, the prototroch and telotroch. Larvae exhibit positive phototactic behavior in which they swim towards light, potentially an adaptation to aid in larval dispersal C. teleta is an indirect developer and undergoes metamorphosis from a swimming larva into a burrowing juvenile.  Metamorphosis is characterized by cilia loss, body elongation, and crawling behavior. Marine sediment functions as a cue to initiate metamorphosis into juvenile worms that thereafter grow into mature adults. Competent larvae can be induced to metamorphose into juveniles when exposed to the B vitamins Nicotinamide (B3) and Riboflavin (B2), suggesting that these chemical compounds may be responsible for the inductive role of the marine sediment in larval metamorphosis. The number of offspring in each brood tube can vary between 50 - 400 individuals, and is influenced by food quality.\n\nAfter metamorphosis, the juveniles begin burrowing and feeding. The juvenile worms continue to grow and add segments during the eight weeks it takes to become sexually mature adults. Males and females can reproduce multiple times during their lifetime. Adults live approximately 12–14 weeks after maturation.\n\nFeeding \nCapitella teleta feeds on the enriched sediment in which it burrows. C. teleta has a complex, regionalized alimentary canal consisting of a foregut, midgut and hindgut. It ingests the sediment by everting its proboscis, which contains a ciliated, muscular dorsal pharynx. Presence of a dorsal pharynx is uncommon in marine polychaetes, and this adaptation may have evolved independently in the family Capitellidae through selective pressures on feeding mode in the benthic marine niche they occupy.\n\nResearch \n\nA wide range of techniques have been developed to investigate C. teleta developmental processes. In 2006, the first study using whole mount in situ hybridization was published. This technique allows investigation of the expression and localization of specific mRNAs within a fixed sample. Immunohistochemistry was later developed as a way to visualize specific cell types in fixed specimens. A microinjection protocol for uncleaved embryos and early cleavage stages was developed in 2010 and was used in a fate mapping study to investigate the ultimate fate of blastomeres."

                "document": "Location and topography\nWakatobi National Park is located south-east of Sulawesi, between 05°12’-06°10’S and 123°20’-124°39’E, between the Banda Sea to the north-east and the Flores Sea to the south-west.\n\nIt consists of four larger islands: Wangi-Wangi, Kaledupa, Tomia and Binongko, as well as many small islands such as Tokobao, North Lintea, South Lintea, Kampenaune, Hoga and Tolandono. The highest elevation is  on Wangi-Wangi, followed by Lagole Hill (271m) on Tomia, Terpadu Hill (222 m) on Binongko and Mount Sampuagiwolo (203 m) on Kadelupa. The water depth varies, with the deepest parts reaching .\n\nIt is the third largest marine park in Indonesia. Jacques Cousteau is said to have called the Wakatobi islands – then known as the Tukangbesi islands:  an \"Underwater Nirvana\". Now a national marine park covering the entire Waktobi District, it comprises 1.4 million hectares, of which 900,000 host tropical coral reefs. Wakatobi has the highest number of reef and fish species in the world. The islands form the largest barrier reef in Indonesia, second in the world only to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. It is the habitat of large and small fish species, dolphins, turtles and whales. The island group comprises 143 islands of which 7 are inhabited, counting a total population of around 100,000. Most notable are the Bajo communities, seafaring nomads who inhabit many of Indonesia’s remote islands.\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nLocated in the Asia-Pacific World Coral Triangle, in the province of Southeast Sulawesi, the Wakatobi Islands offer clear waters and a rich bio-diverse underwater life. Wakatobi hosts 942 fish species and 750 coral reef species (of 850 globally), versus 50 in the Caribbean and 300 in the Red Sea.\n\nHabitats found in the national park are mangrove forest, coastal forest, lowland swamp forest, riverbank vegetation, lowland rainforest, mountain rainforest and coral reefs. The Wakatobi Archipelago has 25 groups of coral reefs including fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls. A survey conducted in 2003 identified 396 species of coral belonging to 68 genera and 15 families. These include Acropora formosa, Acropora hyacinthus, Psammocora profundasafla, Pavona cactus, Leptoseris yabei, Fungia molucensis, Lobophyllia robusta, Merulina ampliata, Platygyra versifora, Euphyllia glabrescens, Tubastraea frondes, Stylophora pistillata, Sarcophyton throchelliophorum, and Sinularia species.\n\nAmong the recorded species of seabirds are the brown booby, common kingfisher and Malaysian plover.\n\nTurtles in the park include the hawksbill, loggerhead and olive ridley.\n\nHuman habitation\nThe main settlement on the islands is the administrative centre for the Regency Baubau. In 2001, nearly 90,000 people lived on the islands. The demographics of the region are 91.33 percent Wakatobi, 7.92 percent Bajau, and less than one percent other ethnicities.\n\nThe Bajau people, in particular, rely heavily upon marine resources within the park for survival as a majority of the population are nomadic, subsistence-oriented fishers. Some Bajau fishers utilize techniques such as fish bombing and coral mining, although these methods may detrimentally impact the reef.\n\nConservation and threats\n\nAfter the designation of the Wakatobi Marine Conservation Area in 1996, the Wakatobi National Park was established in 2002. It is managed by the Wakatobi National Park Authority (Balai Taman Nasional). In 2005 the park was listed as a tentative World Heritage Site. In 2012 it was included in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.\n\nWakatobi is a complex marine protected area that contains many zones which allow different levels of fishing and tourism. Areas of coral reefs are usually no-take zones, while open waters are often designated as traditional use zones, where local fishers are allowed to fish and make a living. The no-takes zones make up only 3.2% of the total MPA.\n\nHistorically, Wakatobi has had issues with management and economic stability for local communities. This can be seen when foreigners arrive and exploit the local communities."
